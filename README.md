# Jalda
"Jalda" is a site that allows you to rent everything that other people offer. No buying, no selling, only rent. From offices to technology. Each registered user is able to post their ads and rent out their belongings. For example, a prom dress, which, most often, is worn only once, lies and gathers dust in the closet. Our site will allow unused things to become necessary for someone, albeit for a while.
